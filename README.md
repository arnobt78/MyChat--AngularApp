## Component & File Overview

- **index.html**: Main entry point; loads AngularJS app, links CSS/JS.
- **js/**: JavaScript source directory.
  - **controllers.js**: Handles UI logicâ€”joining chat, sending messages, managing notifications.
  - **services.js**: Contains services for Socket.IO communication, encryption, and storage.
  - **app.js**: AngularJS module setup, routes, and main config.
- **css/**: Application stylesheets for UI.
- **img/**: Image assets for avatars, backgrounds, and icons.
- **config.xml**: Cordova project configuration for app metadata and plugins.
- **package.json**: NPM dependencies, scripts, and project metadata.

---

## API & Routing

The client uses **Socket.IO** for all real-time events; messages are exchanged over WebSockets.

**Key Socket.IO events:**
- `'message'`: Send/receive chat messages.
- `'user joined'`: Notifies when a user joins.
- `'user left'`: Notifies when a user leaves.
- `'typing'`/`'stop typing'`: Typing notifications.

**AngularJS Routing:**
- Default route loads the chat interface.
- Login/Join screen for entering username.
- Main chat view for messaging and notifications.

*Example:*
```js
// In app.js (AngularJS)
angular.module('myChatApp', ['ionic'])
.config(function($stateProvider, $urlRouterProvider) {
  $stateProvider
    .state('login', { url: '/login', templateUrl: 'templates/login.html', controller: 'LoginCtrl' })
    .state('chat', { url: '/chat', templateUrl: 'templates/chat.html', controller: 'ChatCtrl' });
  $urlRouterProvider.otherwise('/login');
});
```

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** and **npm**
- **Ionic CLI** and **Cordova CLI**
- **Git** (to clone the repo)
- (Optional for mobile) **Android Studio** or **Xcode** for emulation

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/arnobt78/MyChat--AngularApp.git
    cd MyChat--AngularApp
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Install Ionic and Cordova globally (if not already):**
    ```bash
    npm install -g ionic cordova
    ```

4. **Add mobile platform (optional):**
    ```bash
    ionic cordova platform add android
    # or
    ionic cordova platform add ios
    ```

---

## How to Run

### Run in Browser (Development)

```bash
ionic serve
```
> Opens app in default browser with live reload.

### Run on Android/iOS Device or Emulator

```bash
ionic cordova run android
# or
ionic cordova run ios
```

### Build for Production

```bash
ionic build --prod
```

---

## Usage Guide

- **Login/Register**: Enter a username to join the chat.
- **Start Chatting**: Type messages to chat in real time with all connected users.
- **Notifications**: See when users join, leave, or are typing.
- **Encryption**: All messages are encrypted for privacy.
- **Mobile Experience**: Install the app on your device for a native-like experience.

---

## Functionality Walkthrough

### 1. User Authentication
- No password required; just pick a username to join.
- Username is stored locally for session persistence.

### 2. Real-Time Messaging
- Messages are sent/received instantly via Socket.IO.
- UI updates in real time for all users in the chat room.

### 3. Encryption
- Messages are encrypted client-side before transmission.
- Example (in service):
    ```js
    function encryptMessage(msg, key) {
      // Simple encryption (for demo)
      return btoa(msg + key);
    }
    ```

### 4. Persistent Storage
- Chat history is saved in local DB (IndexedDB/SQLite).
- On app load, chat history is restored automatically.

### 5. Notifications
- When users join, leave, or are typing, the UI shows toast or banner notifications.

### 6. Responsive UI
- Built with Ionic for adaptive layouts.
- Looks and works great on both mobile and desktop.

## Examples

### Example: Sending a Message

```js
$scope.sendMessage = function() {
  if ($scope.message.length) {
    var encrypted = encryptMessage($scope.message, userKey);
    socket.emit('message', { user: $scope.username, text: encrypted });
    $scope.message = '';
  }
};
```
